# Setup and Installation

## Prerequisites

To get started with the **Bicycle Rental System**, you’ll need:

- **Node.js** and **npm**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
  - This installs `npm` as well, which you’ll use to manage dependencies.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. **Open your terminal**.
2. **Clone the repo** by running:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohammed12des/Bicycle-Rental-System.git
   ```
3. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Bicycle-Rental-System
   ```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies

1. **Install backend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Navigate to the `client` directory** (if there's a React frontend):
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Step 3: Running the Project

1. **Start the backend**:
   - Go back to the root directory:
     ```bash
     cd ..
     ```
   - Run the backend server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

2. **Start the frontend (if applicable)**:
   - If there's a `client` directory, start the React app:
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm start
     ```

That’s it! Now you can start building on the project.
